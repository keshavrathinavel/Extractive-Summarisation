# Extractive-Summarisation
Synopsis Derived using Extractive Summarisation for Patient Notes

Developed a model that creates summarised extracts from given detailed accounts of patient notes, experiences and symptoms. The model uses Cosine similarity matrix and graph-based Lexical Centrality to achieve the aforementioned. 

The model has been developed keeping in mind medical professionals' convenience and thus, shortens extracts, keeping important recognised data and corrects existing data using tokenized lemmatization.

Entity Recognition has also been implemented to provide a means to categorize words according to their meaning and roots.
